# potato-disease-classification
Predicting if a potato plant is affected by either early blight, late blight or is a healthy plant based on an image of the plant's leaf.

I have used a tensorflow CNN model and pre-quantized the model for reducing the lose in performance after the model is convert to tflite model. 

The future of this project will be creating a react native app which takes an image of the leaf as the input and predicts the disease using the above tflite model.
